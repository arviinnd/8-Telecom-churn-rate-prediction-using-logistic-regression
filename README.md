Subject: use case on telecom industry using logistic regression <br>
<br>
Respected everyone, <br>
This is a use case on telecom industry where our task is to understand the data, build a logistic regression model using 
train data and then test the model over test data. After, doing basic data analysis, we drew some inferences. Then we did 
data visualization by plotting graphs between features and their respective frequencies. Then we built a logistic regression 
model on the train data and validated it with test data. However, the data is imbalanced and we have to balance the data by 
oversampling. We then find and plot the confusion matrix. The future work may include regularization, feature selection and 
using non-linear model. <br>
<br>
Thanks and regards, <br>
Yours sincerely, <br>
